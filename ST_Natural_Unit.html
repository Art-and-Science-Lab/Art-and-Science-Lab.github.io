        <h2>Philosophy of Natural Units</h2>
        <p>
            Natural units originate from the idea proposed by Max Planck in 1900:
            a system of units that is independent of civilization, observers, and measurement environments, and common to all of nature.
            The Planck unit system defines the speed of light c, Planck's constant \(\hbar\),
            the gravitational constant G, and Boltzmann's constant kB all as "1",
            so that the Planck length, Planck time, Planck mass, and Planck temperature all become "1".
        </p>
        </section>


        <div class="equations">
            \[
            \ell_{\mathrm{P}}=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^{3}}}
            \]
            \[
            t_{\mathrm{P}}=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^{5}}}
            \]
            \[
            m_{\mathrm{P}}=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}}
            \]
            \[
            T_{\mathrm{P}}=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^{5}}{G\,k_{\mathrm{B}}^{2}}}
            \]
        </div>

        <p>
            This was an extremely beautiful idea, aiming to detach physical laws from artificial human-defined units. 
            At the same time, however, the physical meaning of these particular combinations of constants is not necessarily transparent.
            Moreover, in actual physics, what is set equal to "1" depends on the field, and natural unit systems are not uniquely defined.
            Inheriting the spirit of Planck units, we propose a new natural unit system that explicitly incorporates physical interpretation.

        <h2>Space-Time Unit (ST Unit System)</h2>

        <p>
            In the historical development of physics, the kilogram and the coulomb were defined first, 
            and in order to maintain the consistency of physical laws, the gravitational constant \(G\), 
            the vacuum permittivity \(\varepsilon_0\), and the vacuum permeability \(\mu_0\) were introduced afterward.
            However, when the roles of \(G\), \(\varepsilon_0\), and \(\mu_0\) appearing in Newton's law of gravitation 
            and Coulomb's law are reexamined dimensionally, it becomes clear that the kilogram and the coulomb 
            are in fact derived space-time units:
            \[
            \mathrm{kg} \;\rightarrow\; \mathrm{m^3/s^2}, \qquad 
            \mathrm{C} \;\rightarrow\; \mathrm{m^2/s}.
            \]
            We collectively refer to this system of units as the Space-Time (ST) unit system (see References).

        <h2>Transformation from SI Units to ST Units</h2>

        <p>
            In the ST unit system, the kilogram and the coulomb are transformed by the \(\mu\)-converter 
            and the \(\varepsilon\)-converter, respectively.
            Transforming the SI electron mass \(m_e\) and elementary charge \(e\) into the ST electron mass \(m_0\) 
            and elementary charge \(e_0\), we obtain
        </p>

        <div class="equations">
            \[
            m_0 = \mu m_e, \quad 
            \mu = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\left(\frac{e c}{m_e}\right)^2
            \]

            \[
            e_0 = \varepsilon e, \quad 
            \varepsilon = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{e c}{m_e}
            \]
        </div>

        <p>
            Since the gravitational constant G contains the kilogram in the denominator, 
            it is transformed into a dimensionless constant \(\beta_0\) in the ST unit system.

        <p>
            Furthermore, because the vacuum permittivity \(\varepsilon_0\) and vacuum permeability \(\mu_0\) can be expressed solely in terms of geometry and the defined constant c, 
            we deliberately introduce no new symbols for them in the ST system.

            In the ST system, it is in principle possible to absorb \(\alpha_0\) into \(\hbar\).
            However, in order to preserve symmetry with the Gravitational-Electromagnetic Ratio, 
            the ST natural unit system separates \(\hbar\) and \(\alpha_0\).

        <h2>Generative Structure of Physical Quantities in the ST System</h2>

            As a result, in the ST unit system, all physical units can be constructed solely from the elementary charge \(e_0\) and the speed of light c.
            Within this structure, the speed of light is not merely a constant, but acts as an operator that generates hierarchical levels of physical quantities.

        Length \( (e_0 c^{-1}) \) necessarily coincides with the classical electron radius \( r_0 \), and Time \( (e_0 c^{-2}) \) corresponds to the time \( t_0 \) required for 
        light to traverse the classical electron radius.
        From this fundamental length and fundamental time, the speed of light \( c \), elementary charge \( e_0 \), electron mass \( m_0 \), Planck constant \( \hbar_0 \), 
        and electron rest energy \( E_0 = m_0 c^2 \) are all determined inevitably.

        <h2>ST Natural Unit System</h2>

        <p>
            Therefore, simply by defining the fundamental length \( r_0 \) and fundamental time \( t_0 \) as "1", a natural unit system is constructed in which the speed of light, 
            elementary charge, electron mass, Planck constant, and electron rest energy all simultaneously become "1".
        </p>

        <h2>Rationality of Choosing the Classical Electron Radius as the Reference Length</h2>

        <p>
            When the classical electron radius \( r_0 \) is adopted as the reference length, the principal physical constants can be expressed as powers of 
            the inverse fine-structure constant.
        </p>

        <div class="table-wrap">
            <table>
                <tr><th>Quantity</th><th>Value</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Classical electron radius</td><td>\( 1 \)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Compton length</td><td>\( 2\pi \alpha_0 \)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Bohr radius</td><td>\( \alpha_0^{2} \)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Inverse Rydberg constant</td><td>\( 4\pi \alpha_0^{3} \)</td></tr>
            </table>
        </div>

        <p>
            In this way, within the ST natural unit system, fundamental physical constants naturally become "1" without losing their physical meaning, and physical laws can be 
            described solely by geometric structure and the dimensionless constants \( \alpha_0 \) and \( \beta_0 \).
