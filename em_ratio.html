        <p>
          During my time at Western Washington University, two laboratory experiments left a particularly strong impression on me:
          one that measured the speed of light directly, and another that measured the electron charge-to-mass ratio
          (<span class="math">\(e/m_e\)</span>).
          In particular, J. J. Thomson’s cathode-ray measurement (1897) can be described using the electric field
          <span class="math">\(E\)</span>, the magnetic field <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, and the curvature radius
          <span class="math">\(r\)</span> of the electron-beam trajectory:
        </p>

        <p class="math">
          \[
            \frac{e}{m_e}=\frac{E}{B^2 r}
          \]
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="em_ratio.png"
               alt="Schematic of the cathode ray tube with crossed E and B fields and the curvature radius r."
               style="max-width:100%; height:auto;" />
          <figcaption>...</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Today, precision techniques such as the Penning trap determine <span class="math">\(e/m_e\)</span> with
          about ten decimal digits of precision. A commonly quoted value is
        </p>

        <p class="math">
          \[
            \frac{e}{m_e}=1.75882001076(89)\times 10^{11}\ \mathrm{C/kg}.
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          Below, we assume typical laboratory-scale values to check the order of magnitude.
          For example, if <span class="math">\(E=2\times10^4\ \mathrm{N/C}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B=1\ \mathrm{mT}\)</span>, then
        </p>

        <p class="math">
          \[
            r=\frac{E}{B^2(e/m_e)}
            =\frac{2\times10^4}{(1\ \mathrm{mT})^2\cdot 1.75882001\times10^{11}}
            =11.371260205\ \mathrm{cm}.
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus the curvature radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is a realistic value of about 11.4 cm.
        </p>

        <h3>Reinterpretation in the Space-Time (ST) Unit System</h3>

        <p>
          We revisit the gravitational law in Newtonian mechanics and Coulomb’s law, and reconsider the roles of the
          gravitational constant <span class="math">\(G\)</span>, vacuum permittivity <span class="math">\(\varepsilon_0\)</span>,
          and vacuum permeability <span class="math">\(\mu_0\)</span>.
          We propose that the kilogram and the coulomb are conventional (human-defined) units and can be represented,
          in essence, as derived units built from the basic units of length (m) and time (s).
          We refer to this redefinition framework as the Space-Time (ST) unit system (see Reference).
        </p>

        <p>
          In the ST unit system, the kilogram and coulomb are converted by transformation coefficients as follows:
        </p>

        <p class="math">
          \[
            \delta\cdot \mathrm{kg}=2.780252259\times10^{23}\ \mathrm{m^3/s^2}
          \]
          \[
            \varepsilon\cdot \mathrm{C}=5.272809743\times10^{12}\ \mathrm{m^2/s}.
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          Since both the electric field <span class="math">\(E\)</span> and the magnetic field <span class="math">\(B\)</span>
          contain <span class="math">\(\mathrm{kg}\)</span> in the numerator and <span class="math">\(\mathrm{C}\)</span> in the denominator in their dimensions,
          the ST conversion is obtained by applying the ratio <span class="math">\(\delta/\varepsilon\)</span>.
          For the same <span class="math">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> used above, we define
        </p>

        <p class="math">
          \[
            E_0=E\cdot\frac{\delta}{\varepsilon},\qquad
            B_0=B\cdot\frac{\delta}{\varepsilon}.
          \]
        </p>

        <p>Numerically, this gives</p>

        <p class="math">
          \[
            E_0=
            2\times10^4\cdot
            \frac{2.780252259\times10^{23}}{5.272809743\times10^{12}}
            =1.054561949\times10^{24}\ \mathrm{m^2/s^3}
          \]
          \[
            B_0=
            1\ \mathrm{mT}\cdot
            \frac{2.780252259\times10^{23}}{5.272809743\times10^{12}}
            =5.272809743\times10^{16}\ \mathrm{m/s^2}.
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          Here, <span class="math">\(E_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B_0\)</span> are the ST-unit representations of the electric and magnetic fields.
          Next, using Thomson’s relation, we evaluate the inverse charge-to-mass ratio in the ST unit system:
        </p>

        <p class="math">
          \[
            \frac{m_0}{e_0}=\frac{B_0^2 r}{E_0}.
          \]
        </p>

        <p>Substituting the values above, we obtain</p>

        <p class="math">
          \[
            \frac{m_0}{e_0}
            =
            \frac{(5.272809743\times10^{16})^2\cdot 11.371260205\ \mathrm{cm}}
            {1.054561949\times10^{24}}
            =
            2.9979246\times10^{8}\ \mathrm{m/s}.
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          This value matches the speed of light <span class="math">\(c\)</span> up to the 7th decimal place.
          In the ST unit system, we therefore have
        </p>

        <p class="math">
          \[
            c=\frac{m_0}{e_0},
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          and the numerical agreement above can be understood as a direct consequence of this relation.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h3>Penning Traps and Frequency-Based Determination</h3>

        <p>
          In Penning-trap measurements, <span class="math">\(e/m_e\)</span> is determined through magnetic-field calibration and frequency measurement.
          In the ST unit system, since <span class="math">\(c\)</span> is an invariant constant, the angular frequency
          <span class="math">\(\omega_f\)</span> is determined solely by the ST magnetic field <span class="math">\(B_0\)</span>:
        </p>

        <p class="math">
          \[
            \omega_f=\frac{B_0}{c}.
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          From the ST-unit viewpoint, both Thomson’s cathode-ray experiment and Penning-trap precision measurements can be interpreted as
          measuring quantities directly tied to the speed of light, but from different angles.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since Copernicus, for roughly five centuries, we have treated mass as an absolute base unit.
          However, both the kilogram and the coulomb are fundamentally conventional units.
          By redefining them in ST units, new facets of physical laws become visible.
