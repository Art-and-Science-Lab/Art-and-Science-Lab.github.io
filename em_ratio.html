        <p>
            During my time at Western Washington University, two laboratory experiments left a particularly strong impression on me:
            one that measured the speed of light directly, and another that measured the electron charge-to-mass ratio (\(e/m_e\)).
            In particular, J. J. Thomson's cathode-ray measurement (1897) can be described using the electric field \(E\),
            the magnetic field \(B\), and the curvature radius \(r\) of the electron-beam trajectory:
        </p>

        <p class="eq">
            \[
            \frac{e}{m_e}=\frac{E}{B^2 r}
            \]
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="em_ratio.png"
                alt="Schematic of the cathode ray tube with crossed E and B fields and the curvature radius r."
                style="max-width:100%; height:auto;" />
            <figcaption>

            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Today, precision techniques such as the Penning trap determine \(e/m_e\) with about ten decimal digits of precision.
            A commonly quoted value is
        </p>

        <p class="eq">
            \[
            \frac{e}{m_e}=1.75882001076(89)\times 10^{11}\ \mathrm{C/kg}.
            \]
        </p>

        <p>
            Below, we assume typical laboratory-scale values to check the order of magnitude.
            For example, if \(E=2\times10^4\ \mathrm{N/C}\) and \(B=1\ \mathrm{mT}\), then
        </p>

        <p class="eq">
            \[
            r=\frac{E}{B^2(e/m_e)}
            =\frac{2\times10^4}{(1\ \mathrm{mT})^2\cdot 1.75882001\times10^{11}}
            =11.371260205\ \mathrm{cm}.
            \]
        </p>

        <p>
            Thus the curvature radius \(r\) is a realistic value of about 11.4 cm.
        </p>

        <h3>Reinterpretation in the Space-Time (ST) Unit System</h3>

        <p>
            We revisit the gravitational law in Newtonian mechanics and Coulomb's law, and reconsider the roles of the
            gravitational constant \(G\), vacuum permittivity \(\varepsilon_0\), and vacuum permeability \(\mu_0\).
            We propose that the kilogram and the coulomb are conventional (human-defined) units and can be represented,
            in essence, as derived units built from the basic units of length (m) and time (s).
            We refer to this redefinition framework as the Space-Time (ST) unit system (see Reference).
        </p>

        <p>
            In the ST unit system, the kilogram and coulomb are converted by transformation coefficients as follows:
        </p>

        <p class="eq">
            \[
            \delta\cdot \mathrm{kg}=2.780252259\times10^{23}\ \mathrm{m^3/s^2}
            \]
            \[
            \varepsilon\cdot \mathrm{C}=5.272809743\times10^{12}\ \mathrm{m^2/s}.
            \]
        </p>

        <p>
            Since both the electric field \(E\) and the magnetic field \(B\) contain \(\mathrm{kg}\) in the numerator and
            \(\mathrm{C}\) in the denominator in their dimensions, the ST conversion is obtained by applying the ratio
            \(\delta/\varepsilon\).
            For the same \(E\) and \(B\) used above, we define
        </p>

        <p class="eq">
            \[
            E_0=E\cdot\frac{\delta}{\varepsilon},\qquad
            B_0=B\cdot\frac{\delta}{\varepsilon}.
            \]
        </p>

        <p>Numerically, this gives</p>

        <p class="eq">
            \[
            E_0=
            2\times10^4\cdot
            \frac{2.780252259\times10^{23}}{5.272809743\times10^{12}}
            =1.054561949\times10^{24}\ \mathrm{m^2/s^3}
            \]
            \[
            B_0=
            1\ \mathrm{mT}\cdot
            \frac{2.780252259\times10^{23}}{5.272809743\times10^{12}}
            =5.272809743\times10^{16}\ \mathrm{m/s^2}.
            \]
        </p>

        <p>
            Here, \(E_0\) and \(B_0\) are the ST-unit representations of the electric and magnetic fields.
            Next, using Thomson's relation, we evaluate the inverse charge-to-mass ratio in the ST unit system:
        </p>

        <p class="eq">
            \[
            \frac{m_0}{e_0}=\frac{B_0^2 r}{E_0}.
            \]
        </p>

        <p>Substituting the values above, we obtain</p>

        <p class="eq">
            \[
            \frac{m_0}{e_0}
            =
            \frac{(5.272809743\times10^{16})^2\cdot 11.371260205\ \mathrm{cm}}
            {1.054561949\times10^{24}}
            =
            2.9979246\times10^{8}\ \mathrm{m/s}.
            \]
        </p>

        <p>
            This value matches the speed of light \(c\) up to the 7th decimal place.
            In the ST unit system, we therefore have
        </p>

        <p class="eq">
            \[
            c=\frac{m_0}{e_0},
            \]
        </p>

        <p>
            and the numerical agreement above can be understood as a direct consequence of this relation.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h3>Penning Traps and Frequency-Based Determination</h3>

        <p>
            In Penning-trap measurements, \(e/m_e\) is determined through magnetic-field calibration and frequency measurement.
            In the ST unit system, since \(c\) is an invariant constant, the angular frequency \(\omega_f\) is determined solely
            by the ST magnetic field \(B_0\):
        </p>

        <p class="eq">
            \[
            \omega_f=\frac{B_0}{c}.
            \]
        </p>

        <p>
            From the ST-unit viewpoint, both Thomson's cathode-ray experiment and Penning-trap precision measurements can be
            interpreted as measuring quantities directly tied to the speed of light, but from different angles.
        </p>

        <p>
            For nearly five centuries since the time of Copernicus, mass has been accepted as a fundamental unit. However, when physical formulas are reexamined
            at a fundamental level, it becomes clear that the kilogram and the coulomb are not intrinsic features of nature, but units defined by human convention.
            Furthermore, the proportional constants associated with them-such as the gravitational constant, the vacuum permittivity, and the vacuum permeability-can
            be understood as non-essential constants introduced to preserve the internal consistency of a unit system based on the kilogram and the coulomb.
            Once the true nature of the kilogram and the coulomb is redefined, physical formulas begin to reveal a different structure, and new aspects of physical law
            emerge before us.
