        <p>
          In the current International System of Units (SI), the kilogram and the ampere are defined as base units.
          However, this classification reflects a historically contingent, human-centered choice made for measurement convenience,
          not a necessity imposed by nature.
          In this note, We argue that mass and electric charge are not fundamental units but constructed quantities
          derived from deeper spacetime relations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, We show that the gravitational constant \(G\), the vacuum permittivity \(\varepsilon_0\),
          and the vacuum permeability \(\mu_0\) function as proportional constants introduced to maintain consistency
          within the human-defined unit system of kilograms and coulombs, rather than intrinsic constants of nature.
        </p>

        <p>
          To state the conclusion first: the kilogram is redefined through the \(\delta\)-transformation
          and expressed as a purely spacetime dimension \(\mathrm{m^3/s^2}\).
        </p>

        <div class="equations">
          \[
            m_0 = m_e \,\delta \approx 253\ \mathrm{m^3/s^2}
          \]
          \[
            \delta = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\left(\frac{e\,c}{m_e}\right)^2
          \]
        </div>

        <p>
          Likewise, the coulomb (electric charge unit) is redefined via the \(\varepsilon\)-transformation,
          reducing charge to a spacetime dimension as well.
        </p>

        <div class="equations">
          \[
            e_0 = e\,\varepsilon \approx 8.45\times 10^{-7}\ \mathrm{m^2/s}
          \]
          \[
            \varepsilon = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\left(\frac{e\,c}{m_e}\right)
          \]
        </div>

        <p class="note">
          Here, \(c\) is the speed of light, \(e\) is the elementary charge, \(m_e\) is the electron mass,
          and \(\mu_0\) is the vacuum permeability.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result, an extremely simple relation emerges—reminiscent of Einstein’s rest-mass energy relation:
        </p>

        <div class="equations">
          \[
            m_0 = e_0\,c
          \]
        </div>

        <p>
          We call this transformation framework the <strong>Space-Time Unit (ST unit)</strong>.
          In the ST unit system, the unit structure necessarily collapses onto the electron scale,
          and the classical electron radius is defined as the fundamental length.
        </p>

        <p>
          The fundamental time is then defined as the time required for light to traverse this classical electron radius.
          From this fundamental length and fundamental time, the elementary charge, the electron mass,
          and the electron rest-mass energy are consistently defined.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consequently, by setting this fundamental length and fundamental time equal to unity,
          a natural unit system necessarily emerges—distinct from the Planck natural units.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this way, simply redefining mass and charge—historically introduced as independent quantities—
          leads to a remarkable simplification of physical formulas, restoring a more intuitive structure
          to fundamental physics. For detailed derivations and the full theoretical framework, please refer to:
