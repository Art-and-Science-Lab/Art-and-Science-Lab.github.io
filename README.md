# Art & Science Lab

Art & Science Lab is an open research space dedicated to re-examining what we take for granted and reconstructing our ways of seeing the world, across philosophy, mathematics, physics, life sciences, and Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART).

Albert Einstein once said:  
“Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.”

Even what seems obvious can reveal an entirely different world when we question it.

- Are kilogram and coulomb truly fundamental units?  
- Why is π defined by diameter rather than radius — wouldn’t radius be more natural?  
- What is a probability distribution? What does statistics really mean?

This site explores such questions from a unified scientific perspective, grounded in physics and mathematics, while extending into life sciences, ART (reproductive medicine), and even social and economic systems.

## About

The author began with mathematics and physics, conducted research in laser photonics, laser photomedicine, and light–cell interactions, and is now working in the field of Assisted Reproductive Technology (reproductive medicine).

The name “Art & Science” plays on both ART (reproductive technology) and Art as human creativity.

Neither humanity nor knowledge forms a closed system — everything is connected.  
Disciplinary “walls” are human constructions.

Art & Science Lab aims to rethink the world through a flexible, interdisciplinary perspective.
